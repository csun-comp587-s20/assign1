How to rename branch name after it was created:
Checkout to the branch you need to rename: $ git checkout <old-name>
Rename branch name locally: $ git branch -m <new-name>
Delete old branch from remote: $ git push origin :<old-name> <new-name>
Reset the upstream branch for the new branch name: $ git push origin -u <new-name>
